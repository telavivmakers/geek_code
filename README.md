# The Geek Code 4.0

The geek code attempts a concise description of your being in ‘geek space’, spanning key dimensions using a small set of categories and quantifying them with qualifiers.

The code consists of a set of alphanumeric identifiers indicating the various categories (and subcategories), and qualifiers + and – following the identifiers indicating amount/size/level of proficiency/etc. These qualifiers can be stacked, e.g s+++ indicates a person of extreme height (the s indicating size).

The broad categories encoded are: Wetware, Computers, Politics, Entertainment, Lifestyle. Most have subcategories; one can answer at any level of detail desired, thus eg. U++ indicates someone highly interested/proficient in Unix, while ULDU++ indicates someone into unix-linux-debian-ubuntu. Multiple subcategories can be indicated with a forward slash, e.g GH/C indicates a Geek of Humanities and Classics.

Some categories will be irrelevant, so ignore them. Some of the qualifiers will not match with you exactly, so choose that qualifier that most closely matches you.

Given a set of category/qualifier strings for any of the above (skip anything you dont want to answer/not relevant/classified/unknown/indeterminate/etc) it’s time to assemble your code for displaying to the world. Take the substrings and concatenate with a space between. When completed, it will look something like the following:

GED/J d– s:++>: a– C++(++++) ULU++ P+ L++ E—- W+(-) N+++ o+ K+++ w— O- M+ V– PS++>$ PE++>$ Y++ PGP++ t- 5+++ X++ R+++>$ tv+ b+ DI+++ D+++ G+++++ e++ h r– y++**

A GEEK CODE BLOCK similar to the output created by the PGP program attempts to universalize how you will see the Geek Code around the net and looks like the following:
```
—–BEGIN GEEK CODE BLOCK—–
Version: 3.1
GED/J d– s:++>: a– C++(++++) ULU++ P+ L++ E—- W+(-) N+++ o+ K+++ w—
O- M+ V– PS++>$ PE++>$ Y++ PGP++ t- 5+++ X++ R+++>$ tv+ b+ DI+++ D+++
G+++++ e++ h r– y++**
——END GEEK CODE BLOCK——
```
### Special characters

A few special characters allow for the (ultimately wrong but practically useful) notion that geeks can seldom be strictly quantified.

@
for this variable, said trait is not very rigid, may change with time or with individual interaction. For example, Geeks who happen to very much enjoy Star Trek: The Next Generation, but dislike the old 60’s series might list themselves as t++@.
()
for indicating “cross-overs” or ranges. Geeks who go from C+ to C— depending on the situation (i.e. mostly “C+”) could use C+(—). @ is different from () in that () has finite limits within the category, while @ ranges all over.
>
for ‘wannabe’ ratings. Indicating that while the geek is currently at one rating, they are striving to reach another. For example, C++>$ indicating a geek that is currently computer savvy, but wants to someday make money at it.
$
Indicates that this particular category is done for a living. For example, UL+++$ indicates that the person utilizes Unix and gets paid for it. Quite a lucky geek, for sure.
?
Unless stated otherwise within the specific category, the ? is placed after the category identifier and indicates that the geek has no knowledge about that specific category. For example, a person that has never even heard of Babylon 5, would list their Babylon 5 category as 5?
!
Placed BEFORE the category. Unless stated otherwise, indicates that the person refuses to participate in this category. This is unlike the ? variable as the ? indicates lack of knowledge, while the ! indicates stubborn refusal to participate. For example, !E would be a person that just plain refuses to have anything to do with Emacs, while E? would be a person that doesn’t even know what Emacs is.

## The categories

==============================================================
### G – Graduate or Undergraduate training/degree/interest

To start a code, a geek must declare himself or herself to be a geek. To do this, we start the code with a “G” to denote “GEEK”, followed by one or two letters to denote the geek’s occupation or field of study. Multi-talented geeks with more than one vocational training should denote their myriad of talents with a slash between each vocation (example: GCS/MU/TW).

```
GB — Geek of Business
GC — Geek of Classics
GCA — Geek of Commercial Arts
GCM — Geek of Computer Management
GCS — Geek of Computer Science
GCC — Geek of Communications
GE — Geek of Engineering
GED — Geek of Education
GFA — Geek of Fine Arts
GG — Geek of Government
GH — Geek of Humanities
GIT — Geek of Information Technology
GJ — Geek of Jurisprudence (Law)
GLS — Geek of Library Science
GL — Geek of Literature
GMC — Geek of Mass Communications
GM — Geek of Math
GMD — Geek of Medicine
GMU — Geek of Music
GPA — Geek of Performing Arts
GP — Geek of Philosophy
GS — Geek of Science (Physics, Chemistry, Biology, etc.)
GSS — Geek of Social Science (Psychology, Sociology, etc.)
GTW — Geek of Technical Writing

GO — Geek of Other. Some types of geeks deviate from the normal geek activities. This is encouraged as true geeks come from all walks of life.
GU — Geek of ‘Undecided’. This is a popular vocation with incoming freshmen.

G! — Geek of no qualifications. A rather miserable existence, you would think.

GAT — Geek of All Trades. For those geeks that can do anything and everything. GAT usually precludes the use of other vocational descriptors.
```
==============================================================

### a,b,c,d - WETWARE (age/beard/clothing/dimensions)

They say you never get a second chance to make a first impression.

The Geek, of course, doesn’t believe any of that crap; on the internet, no one knows you’re a dog , according to ancient legend. In any case this section allows you to list something about what you look like, conceivably for dating purposes or such nonsense.

#### a – Age

The only way to become a true geek is through practice and experience. To this end, your age becomes an important part of your geekiness. Use the qualifiers below to show your age (in Terran years). Also, please use BASE 10 numbers.
```
a+++  60 and up
a++  50-59
a+  40-49
a  30-39
a-  25-29
a– 20-24
a— 15-19
a—- 10-14
a—– 9 and under (Geek in training?)
a? immortal
!a it’s none of your business how old I am
In addition, if you wish to give your exact age, you can place the number after the ‘a’ identifier. For example: a42
```
#### b – beardliness/facial hair
As facial hair plays some sort of role in geek space, serving as an expression of style, countercultural proclivities, etc. etc. and unix beards being a thing we give it a category here despite its irrelevance to some fraction of the population. Also it lets us start off with ‘abcd’ for age/beard/clothing/dimensions

```
b – beard
bm – mustache
bs – sideburns
bb – bushy eyebrows
```
Thus b++/bm++ means impressive beard with equally consequential mustachio. Leave blank for no facial hair.

#### c – Clothing
```
c++ I tend to wear conservative dress such as a business suit or worse, a tie.
c+ Good leisure-wear. Slacks, button-shirt, etc. No jeans, tennis shoes, or t-shirts.
c I dress a lot like those found in catalog ads. Bland, boring, without life or meaning.
c- I’m usually in jeans and a t-shirt.
c– My t-shirts go a step further and have a trendy political message on them.
c— Punk dresser, including, but not limited to, torn jeans and shirts, body piercings, and prominent tattoos.
cx Cross Dresser
c? I have no idea what I am wearing right now, let alone what I wore yesterday.
!c No clothing. Quite a fashion statement, don’t you think?
cpu I wear the same clothes all the time, no matter the occasion, forgetting to do laundry between wearings.
```
#### d – dimensions
Geeks come in many shapes and sizes. Shape code is divided into two parts delimited by a colon, the first indicating height, and the second indicates roundness, thus d+++:+++ indicates extreme height and extreme rotundity.
```
d+++:+++ I usually have to duck through doors/I take up three movie seats.
d++:++ I’m a basketball/linebacker candidate.
d+:+ I’m a little taller/rounder than most.
d: I’m an average geek
d-:- I look up to most people. Everyone tells me to gain a few pounds.
d–:– I look up to damn near everybody. I tend to have to fight against a strong breeze.
d—:— I take a phone book with me when I go out so I can see to eat dinner. My bones are poking through my skin.
```
==============================================================

### C- COMPUTERS

There is a record of geeks that don’t use computers. Unfortunately, they are all dead, having lived in an era of no computers. All modern geeks have some exposure to computers. If you don’t know what a computer is, you need to go back into your shell.

Computers
Most geeks identify themselves by their use of computers and computer networks. In order to quantify your geekiness level on computers, consult the following (consider the term ‘computers’ synonymous with ‘computer network’). This category represents “general” computer aptitude. Categories below will get into specifics.

```
C++++ I’ll be first in line to get the new cybernetic interface installed into my skull.
C+++ You mean there is life outside of Internet? You’re shittin’ me! I haven’t dragged myself to class in weeks.
C++ Computers are a large part of my existence. I code in at least one language
C+ Computers are fun and I enjoy using them. 
C Computers are a tool, nothing more. I use it when it serves my purpose.
C- Anything more complicated than my calculator and I’m screwed.
C– Where’s the on switch?
C— If you even mention computers, I will rip your head off!
```
#### U – UNIX
It seems that a Unix-based operating system is the OS of choice among most geeks. In addition to telling us about your Unix abilities, you can also show which specific Unix OS you are using. To accomplish this, you include a letter showing the brand with your rating. For example: UL++++ would indicate a sysadmin running Linux.

    U – Unix
        UL – Linux
            ULR – RPM
                ULRC – cwntos
                ULRF – fedora
                ULRO – opensuse
                ULRU – urpmi
                ULRA – apt-rpm
            ULD – Debian
                ULDU – ubuntu
                ULDUX 3rd party/discontinued ubuntu
                ULDM – Mepis
                ULDK – Knoppix
            ULP – Pacman
            ULG – Gentoo
            ULS – slackware
            UL* – other
        US – Sun OS/Solaris
        UA – AIX
        UH – HPUX
        UI – IRIX
        UC – SCO Unix
        U* – Some other one not listed
some exaples
```
U++++ I am the sysadmin. If you try and crack my machine don’t be surprised if the municipal works department gets an “accidental” computer-generated order to put start a new landfill on your front lawn or your quota is reduced to 4K.
U+++ I don’t need to crack /etc/passwd because I just modified su so that it doesn’t prompt me. The admin staff doesn’t know I’m here.
U++ I’ve get the entire admin ticked off at me because I am always using all of the CPU time and trying to run programs that I don’t have access to.
U+ I enjoy shell scripting and understand the fundamental importance of the difference between ‘ and `
U I have a Unix account to do my stuff in
U- I have a VMS account.
U– I’ve seen Unix and didn’t like it. DEC rules!
U— Unix geeks are actually nerds in disguise.
```

L – Programming languages .
In v4 you can list a series of languages and your opinions/stance thereupon, for example Lp++/R+ would indicate high proficiency in python and above average knowledge of R.

Lj – java
LC – C programming lang
LCpp – C plus plus
LC# – C sharp
Lvb – visual basic
Lp – Python
Ljs – javascript
Lphp – php
LOC – objective C
Lsql – sql
LP – Perl
LRu – Ruby
LM – matlab
Lasm – assembly
Lgo – go
LR – R

For example
Lp+++
I am Guido
Lp++
I maintain/contribute to the python code base
Lp+
I am a pythonista – love python and use it all the time , consider whether things I say are ‘pythonic’
Lp
I am neutral on python , its ok for some things.
Lp-
Python is for hobbies
Lp–
I do not like python, it is an ugly aberration for people incapable of grasping the subtle power of [C|Lisp|assembly]

F – Frontend

F++
I am a java bean

B – Backend

B+++
I wrote my own database system as current performance limitations were irking me

M – Macintosh
Many geeks have abandoned the character-based computer altogether and moved over to the Macintosh. It in important to give notification of your Mac rating.

M++
I am a Mac guru. Anything those DOS putzes and Unix nerds can do, I can do better, and if not, I’ll write the damn software to do it.
M+
A Mac has it’s uses and I use it quite often.
M
I use a Mac, but I’m pretty indifferent about it.
M-
Macs suck. All real geeks have a character prompt.
M–
Macs do more than suck. They make a user stupid by allowing them to use the system without knowing what they are doing. Mac weenies have lower IQs than the fuzz in my navel.

H – Hardware

H+++
I smithed my own chainmail from iron I smelted with ore mined by means of steam-powered equipment I created from old car parts.

H—
I have used hammers, but only metaphorically.

PGP
Pretty Good Privacy (aka PGP) is a program available on many platforms that will encrypt files so that prying eyes (particularly governmental) can’t look at them.

PGP++++
I am Philip Zimmerman
PGP+++
I don’t send or answer mail that is not encrypted, or at the very least signed. If you are reading this without decrypting it first, something is wrong. IT DIDN’T COME FROM ME!
PGP++
I have the most recent version and use it regularly
PGP+
“Finger me for my public key”
PGP
I’ve used it, but stopped long ago.
PGP-
I don’t have anything to hide.
PGP–
I feel that the glory of the Internet is in the anarchic, trusting environment that so nurtures the exchange of information. Encryption just bogs that down.
PGP—
If you support encryption on the Internet, you must be a drug dealer or terrorist or something like that.
PGP—-
Oh, here is something you all can use that is better (insert Clipper here).

E – Electronics

E+++
I am lady ada

E++
I have fixed broken toasters without removing the plug, such is my skill and need for speed.  

P – POLITICS

The last few years has seen the rise of the political geek. This phenomena is little understood, but some theorize that it has come about because of the popular media’s attempts to demonize the Internet and computer use in general, and the government’s willingness to go along with it. Others propose that the aging geek population has simply started taking an interest in the world around them. Some support the “Sun Spot” theory. As of v4 some new subcategories are added to the PS and PE categories.

PS – Political and Social Issues
Rate where, in general, your political views on different social issues fall. The + and – ratings here roughly indicate left/right on the political spectrum.

Subsubcategories –

PSG – green politics/sustainability/climate
PSL – civil liberties
PSS – gender politics

For example –
PS+++
Legalize drugs! Abolish the government. “Fuck the draft!”
PS++
I give to liberal causes. I march for gay rights. I’m a card carrying member of the ACLU. Keep abortion safe and legal.
PS+
My whole concept of liberalism is that nobody has the right to tell anybody else what to do, on either side of the political fence. If you don’t like it, turn the bloody channel.
PS
I really don’t have an opinion; nobody’s messing with my freedoms right now.
PS-
Label records! Keep dirty stuff off the TV and the Internet.
PS–
Oppose sex education, abortion rights, gay rights. Rush Limbaugh is my spokesman.
PS—
Repent left-wing sinners and change your wicked evil ways. Buchanan/Robertson in ’96.

PE – Politics and Economic Issues
Note this category has been reversed as of v4 to maintain the loose left+ and right- association from the PS category.

PE+++
Capitalism is evil! Government should provide the services we really need. Nobody should be rich.PE++
Keep the government off the backs of businesses. Deregulate as much as possible.
PE+
Distrust both government and business.
PE
It’s ok to increase government spending, so we can help more poor people. Tax the rich! Cut the defense budget!
PE-
Balance the budget with spending cuts and an amendment.
PE–
Abolish antitrust legislation. Raise taxes on everyone but the rich so that the money can trickle-down to the masses.

ENTERTAINMENT

Geeks love to play. No matter their age, all geeks enjoy playing. Of course, the object of this entertainment takes a myriad of different forms. What is it that pushes a geek to play? Is it simply a desire to relive their childhood? Or perhaps there is a piece of geeky genetic code that requires intellectual stimulation. Who knows, maybe it’s a Freudian thing…

In v4, tv/series are given its own category other than star trek which remains for backwards compatibility.

T – TV shows/series/movies
List what you think of a given series

TD – doctorwho
TR&M – rick&MORTY
TF – firefly
TS – stargate
TTBB – the big bang
TB – Babylon5
TI – ‘In search of…’ with Leonard Nimoy
TM – monty python (series/films)
TMM – mad max
TSW – star wars franchise
TG – game of thrones
TLOTR – lord of the rings
TL – lost
Tt – star trek

Exemplary Star Trek info
Tt+++
It’s not just a TV show, it’s a religion. I know all about warp field dynamics and the principles behind the transporter. I have memorized the TECH manual. I speak Klingon. I go to cons with Vulcan ears on. I have no life.
Tt++
It’s the best show around. I have all the episodes and the movies on tape and can quote entire scenes verbatim. I’ve built a few of the model kits too. But you’ll never catch me at one of those conventions. Those people are kooks.
Tt+
It’s a damn fine TV show and is one of the only things good on television any more.
Tt
It’s just another TV show
Tt-
Maybe it is just me, but I have no idea what the big deal with Star Trek is. Perhaps I’m missing something but I just think it is bad drama.
Tt–
Star Trek is just another Space Opera. William Shatner isn’t an actor, he’s a poser! And what’s with this Jean-Luc Picard? A Frenchman with a British accent? Come on. Isn’t Voyager just a rehash of Lost in Space? Has Sisko even breathed in the last two seasons? Come on. I’d only watch this show if my remote control broke.
Tt—
Star Trek SUCKS! It is the worst crap I have ever seen! Hey, all you trekkies out there, GET A LIFE! (William Shatner is a t—)

R – Role Playing
Role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons have long been a part of the traditional geek life. Because geeks often become so involved in their role-playing that they lose touch with reality, include one of the following role-playing codes.

R+++
I’ve written and published my own gaming materials.
R++
There is no life outside the role of the die. I know all of piddly rules of (chosen game). _MY_ own warped rules scare the rest of the players.
R+
I’ve got my weekly sessions set up and a character that I know better than I know myself.
R
Role-Playing? That’s just something to do to kill a Saturday afternoon
R-
Gosh, what an utter waste of time!
R–
Role-Players are instruments of pure evil.
R—
I work for T$R.

R*
I thought life WAS role-playing?

b – Books
In addition (or maybe on the other hand), many geeks have lives that revolve around books.

b++++
I read a book a day. I have library cards in three states. I have discount cards from every major bookstore. I’ve ordered books from another country to get my Favorite Author Fix.
b+++
I consume a few books a week as part of a staple diet.
b++
I find the time to get through at least one new book a month.
b+
I enjoy reading, but don’t get the time very often.
b
I read the newspaper and the occasional book.
b-
I read when there is no other way to get the information.
b–
I did not actually READ the geek code, I just had someone tell me.

c – Comics
Subcategories –
D – Dilbert
X – XKCD
M – Manga

G – The Geek Code

G+++++
I am Robert Hayden
G++++
I have made a suggestion for future versions of the code (note that making a suggestion just to get a G++++ rating doesn’t count, you also have to at least qualify for a G+++ rating 🙂
G+++
I have memorized the entire geek code, and can decode others’ codes in my head. I know by heart where to find the current version of the code on the net.
G++
I know what each letter means, but sometimes have to look up the specifics.
G+
I was once G++ (or higher), but the new versions are getting too long and too complicated.
G
I know what the geek code is and even did up this code.
G-
What a tremendous waste of time this Geek Code is.
G–
Not only a waste of time, but it obviously shows that this Hayden guy needs a life.

LIFESTYLE

Geeks, unlike the lower lifeforms known as nerds, have lives. They have things to do that are in the outside world. Of course, this is usually done with other geeks, but that’s not the point. The point is,, that geeks are not necessarily the outcasts society often believes they are. The fact is that society isn’t kool enough to be included in our activities.

Education
All geeks have a varying amount of education.

e+++++
I am Stephen Hawking
e++++
Managed to get my Ph.D.
e+++
Got a Masters degree
e++
Got a Bachelors degree
e+
Got an Associates degree
e
Finished High School
e-
Haven’t finished High School
e–
Haven’t even entered High School

e*
I learned everything there is to know about life from the “Hitchhiker’s Trilogy”.

Housing
Tell us about your geeky home.

h++
Living in a cave with 47 computers and an Internet feed, located near a Dominoes pizza. See !d.
h+
Living alone, get out once a week to buy food, no more than once a month to do laundry. All surfaces covered.
h
Friends come over to visit every once in a while to talk about Geek things. There is a place for them to sit.
h-
Living with one or more registered Geeks.
h–
Living with one or more people who know nothing about being a Geek and refuse to watch Babylon 5.
h—
Married, (persons living romantically with someone might as well label themselves h—, you’re as good as there already.)
h—-
Married with children – Al Bundy can sympathize

h!
I am stuck living with my parents!
h*
I’m not sure where I live anymore. This lab/workplace seems like home to me.

Relationships
While many geeks are highly successful at having relationships, a good many more are not. Give us the gritty details.

r+++
Found someone, dated, and am now married.
r++
I’ve dated my current S.O. for a long time.
r+
I date frequently, bouncing from one relationship to another.
r
I date periodically.
r-
I have difficulty maintaining a relationship.
r–
People just aren’t interested in dating me.
r—
I’m beginning to think that I’m a leper or something, the way people avoid me like the plague.

!r
I’ve never had a relationship.
r*
signifying membership in the SBCA (Sour Bachelor(ette)’s Club of America). The motto is ‘Bitter, but not Desperate’. First founded at Caltech.
r%
I was going out with someone, but the asshole dumped me.

Sex
Geeks have traditionally had problems with sex (ie, they never have any). Because geeks are so wrapped up in their sexuality (or lack of sexuality for that matter), it is important that the geek be willing to quantify their sexual experiences.

This code also is used to denote the gender of the geek. Females use ‘x’ in this category, while males use ‘y’. Those that do not wish to disclose their gender can use ‘z’. For example:

x+ — A female who has had sex
y+ — A male who has had sex.
z+ — A person (gender undisclosed) who has had sex.

For those persons who do not wish to give out any details of their sex life, the use of z? (where z is the gender code) will allow you to do so.

z+++++
I am Madonna
z++++
I have a few little rug rats to prove I’ve been there. Besides, with kids around, who has time for sex?
z+++
I’m married, so I can get it (theoretically) whenever I want.
z++
I was once referred to as ‘easy’. I have no idea where that might have come from though.
z+
I’ve had real, live sex.
z
I’ve had sex. Oh! You mean with someone else? Then no.
z-
Not having sex by choice.
z–
Not having sex because I just can’t get any…
z—
Not having sex because I’m a nun or a priest.
z*
I’m a pervert.
z**
I’ve been known to make perverts look like angels.

!z
It’s none of your business what my sex life is like !
z?
Sex? What’s that? I’ve had no sexual experiences.
!z+
Sex? What’s that? No experience, willing to learn!
